# Minisystem-Computer-Design
A collaborated comprehensive mini-computer system design. 

# Introduction

This course design is a comprehensive application of computer science theories and knowledge. The mini-system computer is architectured from bottom hardware using Verilog and VHDL languages. Additionally, to finish a complete computer, our team also implement bios, assembler, linker, compiler, simplified programming language, and IDE. 

Specific components are listed below:

* CPU, memory for basic functions
* Interfaces for input and output signals
* Assembler, Linker for transforming assembly language to machine code
* Lex, Yacc for generating compiler codes based on pre-defined programming language rules
* A miniC language defined based on a subset of C language
* An IDE for miniC language integrated compiler, assembler, and linker to transforming miniC to machine code. 

# Knowledge
